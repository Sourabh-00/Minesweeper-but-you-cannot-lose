# Minesweeper-but-you-can-t-lose
It basically shifts the mine to other cell which haven't been opened yet whenever you hit a cell with a mine, other than its just a normal minesweper.

You can perform chording in this version, if you try to perform a chord on an empty cell it will open that cell, this is the bug that i can't get rid of.

Your first click will always lead an to easy start as i have made it so that cell tripped on the first click will have zero mines around it.
This means that your first click will open atleast 8 cells unless your first click is in the corner or at the boundry of the board.
